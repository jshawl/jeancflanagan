# Website for Jean C. Flanagan

by Oliver Pattison and Jean Flanagan

This is a collaborative project created by Oliver Pattison and Jean Flanagan. Design, concept and structure are primarily by Oliver, while content is all Jean's. The site is built using (hopefully) modern, standards-compliant HTML and CSS, as a static site using Jekyll.

The *content* of this site (in _posts directory) is licensed under CC-BY [(Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/deed.en_US). There is an exception for articles (or snippets linking to articles) that were originally published elsewhere are subject to the copyright specified by those media. All content is authored by Jean Flanagan.

### Goals

- Repository for writing and other content for Jean
- Static HTML site built using Jekyll
- Semantic, maintainable HTML
- Mobile-first CSS
- Responsive, high performance design
- Few images except for photo content, mostly typography and simple styles

### Content

- Writing index
    - Self-published content
    - Content published elsewhere
- Photography (later)
- About page

### Implementation Details

- The entire site was designed intentionally around *real* written content and no ipsums or fillers.
- Minimalism drives the design of the site, so the site was built around the most basic and spare forms.
- Limit use of plugins except where absolutely required
- No fancy responsive image tricks, just ~1.5-2x scaled images with heavy optimization (10-40 quality JPEGs run through ImageOptim). Why? There will not be enough images to justify a JavaScript or `<picture>` solution. Most images will be relatively small in file size, and larger feature images will be worth the size/performance trade-off on high resolution screens.

### Requirements

#### Broadly

- OS X (not tested in Linux, but most of this should work)
- SSH authentication on your remote server

#### Specifically

- Ruby (tested on 1.9.3p194)
- Ruby Environment Manager - RVM (tested on 1.21.11)
- Jekyll (tested on 1.1.0) and installed dependencies
- ImageOptim (for rakefile)
- ImageOptim-CLI (for rakefile)
