I’m a science education researcher and writer living in Washington, DC. I’m currently a Research Associate at AAAS Project 2061, where I’ve been since 2009. My research and development focus is on curriculum materials and assessments for K-12 biology education. I also founded and write for the team blog [Sci-Ed](http://blogs.plos.org/scied) on the PLOS network.

My interests include school-based and free-choice science education, science communication, open science, scholarly communication, the nature of science, ethics, evolution, ecology, zoology, animal cognition, paleobiology, biodiversity, and conservation. I especially love the places where science intersects with the arts, humanities, and social sciences. 

While my schedule is quite full, I have some limited availability for freelance writing and editing. Contact me with possible opportunities at: jeancflanagan at gmail.
