As a lifelong casual bird watcher, the title *Feathers* drew me in right away. I grew up in and around an Audubon-designated bird sanctuary, and as I flipped through the book I started to think about how feathers might be a lot of the reason birds had captured my attention. The brilliant colors, the effortless beauty of flight, and the fascinating behaviors of birds could all be most efficiently explained by an examination of feathers. In *Feathers*, Thor Hanson takes a seemingly small topic and surprises you with all the directions it can lead. While the focus is the evolutionary biology of feathers, it touches on everything from fashion, to aircraft, to the down industry, to pens, to the aviaries of the Aztecs, and should entice a broad range of readers.

[Thor Hanson](http://thorhanson.net/About.html) is a field biologist, a self-descriptor he uses often in the book. While not all readers will appreciate the distinction between "biologist" and "field biologist," I think the subtle difference is apparent in his writing. He clearly has many of the hallmarks of the naturalists of an earlier era. He spends an ample amount of time outdoors in direct observation of animals, takes copious field notes, and has an inclination for hands-on exploration of anatomy and physiology. Reading about the University of Vermont’s [field naturalist program](http://www.uvm.edu/~fntrlst/), where he got his master’s, gives you a sense where he’s coming from. Though some of his projects in the “racoon shack”—his outdoor shed/office/workspace—remind me of the pursuits of a nature-obsessed ten-year-old, I think they are illustrative of an immediate joy in and curiosity about the natural world that is less evident in many other scientists and science writers.

While Hanson’s research extends across many fields and industries, he continually comes back to the work of evolutionary ornithologist [Rick Prum](http://www.yale.edu/eeb/prum/index.htm) and his research group at Yale. His fluidly written descriptions of Prum’s research programs were definitely the highlights of the book for me. Prum took a developmental approach to understanding feather evolution early on—his theory centers around the development and structure of feathers: they are tubes, not plates. The idea struck him while teaching:

>I was giving my class the standard scales-to-feathers theory, and by the end of the lecture I realized it didn’t make any sense. Feathers couldn’t have evolved that way!

Neatly following Prum’s “eureka” moment, Hanson treats us to the exciting story of how the evidence to support Prum’s theory has come rolling in, mainly through massive fossil discoveries in the [Yixian formation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yixian_Formation) in China.

Hanson makes an interesting choice in including discussion of Alan Feduccia’s theories and his BAND (Birds Are Not Dinosaurs) group. To be clear, BAND members are not creationists—they are scientists in support of the theory that birds are more like second-cousins of theropod dinosaurs, rather than their direct descendants. However, given the abundant and continually growing evidence that birds did evolve from theropods, many in paleobiology find it frustrating that this still gets talked about, especially in popular media. Yet Hanson uses it to weave an engaging and important story about the scientific process, argumentation, and evidence. He notes:

>…continual reporting on the BAND’s minority viewpoint (in the interest of journalistic fairness) may be perpetuating a controversy that most scientists consider over and done with. But when I pressed him, Prum did admit that certain criticisms had helped refine his thinking, whatever the cost to his blood pressure.

*Feathers* does something else that many popular science and nature books fail to do: it remains quite accessible to non-scientists throughout. Hanson never lets himself stray too far into the technical aspects of the science, and cultivates general interest by including extensive discussion of human interest in feathers instead of simply writing an ornithology book. Although his prose sometimes becomes somewhat awkward when he decides to cut a technical discussion short, I appreciate that he always does. Too many “popular” science books are only easily readable by people with some kind of science background. The book manages to be broad enough that scientists will learn something new, and restrained enough that non-scientists will understand and enjoy it.

Perhaps I particularly enjoyed *Feathers* because it was so personally relatable. I might have been a field biologist too, if I had ever really had the constitution for surviving Maine winters and African summers. For now, I am happy to sit back and read.
